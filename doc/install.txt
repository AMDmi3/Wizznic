Here's how to compile/install wizznic for the 3 officially supported platforms.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your platform is not here, check readme, unofficial (but highly appreciated)
ports exist for other other platforms, some of which are listed there.

You can find the latest releases for on the sourceforce project page:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/wizznic/ under "Files".



GP2X Wiz.
---------
There is a precompiled build for Wiz. No compilation needed.
Install by dragging the wizznic-SOME_VERSION dir and wizznic-SOME_VERSION.ini
file into the "game" dir on the wiz SD card.

If you want to compile it yourself, you'll need your wiz-toolchain installed
and you need to edit the Makefile.wiz to point to your toolchain,
then compile by typing:
	make -f Makefile.wiz
This is for *nix, I don't know how to compile it  for wiz on windows,
my guess is by using cygwin.



Windows.
--------
There should be a precompiled .exe for Windows. - Sometimes a day or two later
because I'm not usally near a windows box.
Simply extract the file (you did that allready, didn't you!;)
and run one of the .bat files.
If you want to compile it yourself, you'll need to configure Code::Blocks
with SDL and the other required libs yourself. There is a Win target in the
project file.



Linux.
------
There is a precompiled .x86-32 bit binary in the source package, however
this might not work with your distribution (either because you run 64 bit)
or if you use another version of one of the libs that the program is compiled
against. So theres a chance you'll have to compile it yourself which
shouldn't be too hard.

You'll need SDL, SDL-mixer, SDL-image, a C compiler and Make or Code::Blocks.
To compile in Code::Blocks, open the project file, and build the Linux target.


Compiling on Linux commandline:
-------------------------------

If you want to run it in the current directory (not install it systemwide)
and save the players files in its own directory
(like it also did in older versions)

Just run this in the source directory:
	make -f Makefile.linux
Then you can run ./wizznic in the source directory.

If you want to install it system-wide, for example have the executable in
/usr/games/ and the data-files in /usr/share/games/wizznic/ and have it save
the players files in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wizznic or $HOME/.wizznic

Type this:
	make -f Makefile.linux DATADIR=/usr/share/games/wizznic/ \
        BINDIR=/usr/games/

	sudo make -f Makefile.linux DATADIR=/usr/share/games/wizznic/ \
        BINDIR=/usr/games/ install

To remove the installation again, type:
	sudo rm -R /usr/games/wizznic /usr/share/games/wizznic

(It's not a mistake that the make BINDIR is /usr/games/ and the
rm command is /usr/games/wizznic)

If don't want the game to be installed systemwide, but you still want
it to save players files in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wizznic or $HOME/.wizznic
then you can compile it with this command:
	make -f Makefile.linux DATADIR="./"

If you want to disable the OpenGL scaling option, add WITH_OPENGL=true to
the make parameters, for example:
	make -f Makefile.linux WITH_OPENGL=false




Additionally for PC versions.
--------
It's possible to compile with the default MAME keymapping for use in an
arcade cabinet, however no coin-functions will work.
To compile with mame keymapping, add -DMAME_CTRL to the make command, or
add the define in codeblocks.
To change controls further or see keymappings, see input.c.


Using the thumbnail-function in gnome:
--------------------------------------
Wizznic can generate thumbnail images of level-files (.wzp) if you wish.
You need the source version of the game because the script
wizznic/tools/wizznic-thumbnailwrapper.sh is needed.
Edit that script:
WIZZNICPATH= should be the full path to your wizznic directory.

Open gconf-editor and go to: desktop > gnome > thumbnailers, rightclick
below "disable all" and select "New Key"
Name: text@wizznic/command
Type: String
Value: /full/path/to/wizznic/tools/wizznic-thumbnailwrapper.sh %i %o %s
Now close the gconf-editor and open it again, navigate to:
desktop > gnome > thumbnailers > text@wizznic and add a new key:
Name: enable
Type: Boolean
Value: True

Now, copy the wizznic/tools/mime/wizznic.xml to /usr/share/mime/packages
and run: sudo update-mime-database
